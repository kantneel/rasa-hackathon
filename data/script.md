Wow it's been a great day of hacking. If only we had time to make some slides for all the great work we did...
No problem let's just make them right now, after all that's what the project is all about anyway.

## begin demo
- Okay first let's add a new slide.

Yeah so it's listening to us, great.
- What problem did we try to solve, exactly?

Yeah so this is what we did.
- Let's put on another new slide. 

Oh we should really introduce ourselves huh
- Can we get the team information on here?

Yeah it's been a blast
